## About ME

Hey! I’m currently enrolled in college and in my senior year of college. I am majoring in Computer Science. I love to work, keep healthy, work hard, learn new things, listen to podcasts, and keep busy. I grew up in Arizona and currently living in Idaho.

I have experience in front-end development, back-end development, full-stack development, mobile development, database development, game development, Arduino programming, and more. I have strong experience in web development and have been studying and programming for 5 years in the area.

I’m excited to elevate my career outside of college and work hard in a position that I love. I am a diligent worker and have work experience that requires technical thinking, and hands-on involvement. I love learning and am a quick learner, wanting to learn and determined to grow.
